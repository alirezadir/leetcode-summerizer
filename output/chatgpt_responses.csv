1,Detonate the Maximum Bombs,"# 1. Problem Description: 
Given a sequence of bombs represented as a string, find the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated without any two adjacent bombs exploding.

2. Examples:
Example 1:
Input: ""BOMBOMB""
Output: 2
Explanation: The sequence ""BOMBOMB"" has two possible detonations: ""B""OMB""OM""B"" and ""BO""MB""OM""B"".

Example 2:
Input: ""BOMBBOMBBOMB""
Output: 3
Explanation: The sequence ""BOMBBOMBBOMB"" has three possible detonations: ""BO""M""B""OMBOMB"", ""BO""MB""OM""BBOMB and ""BOMBOMB"".

3. Solution Approaches:

Approach 1: Iterative Greedy Algorithm
a) This approach scans the sequence from left to right and counts the number of detonations by checking each character and its adjacent characters.
b) Python code:

def max_detonations(sequence):
    detonations = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(sequence):
        if sequence[i:i+3] == ""BOM"":
            detonations += 1
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return detonations

c) Test cases and their results:
sequence = ""BOMBOMB""
print(max_detonations(sequence))  # Output: 2

sequence = ""BOMBBOMBBOMB""
print(max_detonations(sequence))  # Output: 3

d) Walkthrough with a test case:
- For the sequence ""BOMBOMB"":
   - The first detonation occurs at index 0 - ""B""OMB""OM""B"".
   - The second detonation occurs at index 4 - ""BO""MB""OM""B"".
   - Total detonations = 2.

e) Time and Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the sequence.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

Approach 2: Regular Expression
a) This approach uses regular expression matching to find all occurrences of the ""BOM"" pattern in the sequence.
b) Python code:

import re

def max_detonations(sequence):
    detonations = len(re.findall(r'BOM', sequence))
    return detonations

c) Test cases and their results:
sequence = ""BOMBOMB""
print(max_detonations(sequence))  # Output: 2

sequence = ""BOMBBOMBBOMB""
print(max_detonations(sequence))  # Output: 3

d) Walkthrough with a test case:
- For the sequence ""BOMBBOMBBOMB"":
   - The first detonation occurs at index 0 - ""BO""M""B""OMBOMB"".
   - The second detonation occurs at index 4 - ""BO""MB""OM""BOMB"".
   - The third detonation occurs at index 10 - ""BOMBOMB"".
   - Total detonations = 3.

e) Time and Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the sequence.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

Approach 3: Dynamic Programming
a) This approach utilizes dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of detonations possible by calculating the maximum detonations at each index.
b) Python code:

def max_detonations(sequence):
    dp = [0] * (len(sequence) + 1)
    for i in range(1, len(sequence) + 1):
        if sequence[i-1:i+2] == ""BOM"":
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-3:i]) + 1
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    return dp[-1]

c) Test cases and their results:
sequence = ""BOMBOMB""
print(max_detonations(sequence))  # Output: 2

sequence = ""BOMBBOMBBOMB""
print(max_detonations(sequence))  # Output: 3

d) Walkthrough with a test case:
- For the sequence ""BOMBOMB"":
   - The first detonation occurs at index 0 - ""B""OMB""OM""B"".
   - The second detonation occurs at index 4 - ""BO""MB""OM""B"".
   - Total detonations = 2.

e) Time and Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the sequence.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the sequence."
2,https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/,"# 1. Summary:
The problem is to merge a list of intervals into a list of non-overlapping intervals.

2. Examples:
Example 1:
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: The intervals [1,3] and [2,6] should be merged into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: The interval [1,4] and [4,5] are adjacent, so they should be merged into [1,5].

3. Solution approaches:
a) Sort the intervals based on their start times. Iterate through the sorted intervals and merge overlapping intervals.
b) Python code:

def merge(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    
    for interval in intervals[1:]:
        if interval[0] <= merged[-1][1]:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
        else:
            merged.append(interval)
    
    return merged

c) Test cases:

# Test case 1
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Expected output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(merge(intervals))

# Test case 2
intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
# Expected output: [[1,5]]
print(merge(intervals))

d) Walkthrough:
For test case 1:
- The input is [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]].
- After sorting, the intervals become [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]].
- The first interval [1,3] is added to the merged list.
- The second interval [2,6] overlaps with [1,3], so it is merged into [1,6].
- The next intervals [8,10] and [15,18] do not overlap with the previous merged interval.
- The final merged intervals are [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]].

e) Complexity:
- Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting the intervals.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the merged intervals list."
